Code related to Shiozaki, Wang, Lillvis, Xu, Dickson, and Stern (2024) Activity of nested neural circuits drives different courtship songs in Drosophila

This code collection was used to creating figures in the publication "Activity of nested neural circuits drives different courtship songs in Drosophila", Shiozaki, Wang, Lillvis, Xu, Dickson, and Stern. To run the code, it is necessary to download the associated data from Figshare (http://doi.org/2010.25378/janelia.25041485). Please note that the code included in this repository is also incorporated in the package accompanying the associated processed data on Figshare. Therefore, downloading the code separately from here is unnecessary for running it. Raw data and code for preprocessing are available upon request to Hiroshi Shiozaki at shiozaki.h@gmail.com.
